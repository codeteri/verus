Given the share of fuel as part of airline costs, we are keeping a close eye on the oil and jet fuel market,\" Matters said in his presentation.\n\nIATA expects the jet fuel price to average $113.8 a barrel in 2024 -- a total fuel bill of about $281bn for the industry -- or about 31% of airlines' operating costs.\n\nIATA expects African airlines to show a combined net loss of about $500m this year and narrowing to about $400m in 2024.\n\nStill, IATA said passenger demand on the continent was robust and is expected to increase by about 7.3% in 2024 compared with 2023 levels. That would be 3% higher than before the pandemic struck in 2019. Airline capacity on the continent is expected to be 9.4% higher in 2024 compared with 2023 and also 3% more than before the pandemic in 2019.\n\nTough in Africa\n\nAfrica remains a difficult market for airlines to operate in, with the biggest challenges being to economic situations, infrastructure and connectivity, IATA said.\n\nOn a global level, airlines face challenges such as a crunch in the delivery of new aircraft -- a situation Walsh said was \"frustrating\". Airlines also have been affected by unforeseen maintenance issues on some aircraft or engine types as well as delays in the delivery of aircraft parts and of aircraft, limiting their capacity expansion and fleet renewal.\n\nAnother important topic raised by Walsh is sustainability. IATA expects the industry will increase its use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and carbon credits to reduce its carbon footprint. SAF could account for 0.53% of airlines' total fuel consumption in 2024 (at a total cost of $2.4bn).\n\nWalsh also mentioned a focus on increasing diversity in the aviation industry -- especially in technical jobs -- as well as increasing accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nAs for ticket prices, IATA's data shows competition continues to drive benefits for consumers. The average real return fare in 2023 is expected to have been about 20% lower than that of 2019, despite rising costs, especially oil.\n\nAnother aspect Walsh raised was the importance of accountability when delays occur at airports. An IATA survey indicated that 91% of passengers agreed that all parties involved in the delays should play a role in helping affected passengers -- not just the airlines.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"businesslive.co.za", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"BusinessLIVE"}, "authors"=>[],

It needed 60 votes to advance.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a \"sad night in the history of our country.\"\n\nBiden reminded Americans of the atrocities Russia has allegedly carried out so far, including the targeting of civilians, kidnapping of children and attacks on their electrical grid last winter so they'd be without heat and electricity.\n\nHe said this is more than just what could happen in the immediate future, but the long run. Biden warned of U.S. troops possibly joining the fight if Putin were to take over Ukraine and invade a NATO ally, which would trigger Article 5 in which an attack on one NATO member is consider an attack on all.\n\n\"If Putin attacks a NATO ally, if he keeps going, and then he attacks a NATO ally, when we've committed as a NATO member, so we defend every inch of NATO territory, then we'll have something that we don't seek and that we don't have today: American troops fighting Russian troops. American troops fighting Russian troops, if he moves into other parts of NATO,\" he said.\n\nThe president said, \"I'm not prepared to walk away, and I don't think the American people are either.\"\n\nThe delay comes amid Republican demands for what he called far-right border policies to be included in the supplemental package. Biden accused Republicans of \"playing chicken with our national security\" by \"holding Ukraine's funding hostage to their extreme partisan border policies.\"\n\nHe said he's \"willing to do significantly more\" to change border policy, including billions of dollars for border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers, but said the GOP is unwilling to compromise.\n\n\"This has to be a negotiation. Republicans think they get everything they want, without any bipartisan compromise. That's not the answer. That's not the answer. And now they're willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield. And damage our national security in the process,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden said he's already laid out with Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford and other GOP senators what he's willing to compromise on, saying it's \"significantly more,\" and includes \"substantive changes,\" though claimed the GOP are \"unwilling to do it.\"\n\nHe called on Congress to \"do something and do the right thing to stand with the people in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"We're the reason Putin has not totally overrun Ukraine and move beyond that,\" he said. \"This is critical. Petty partisan, angry politics can't get in the way of our responsibility as a leading nation in the world. And literally the entire world is watching.\"", "source"=>{"uri"=>"wbal.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"WBAL"}, "authors"=>[],

Ammonia is a toxic gas.\n\nRoman Mrochko, the head of Kherson's city military administration, said there was no threat to the region's residents.\n\nA separate Russian attack in the wider Kherson region on Thursday wounded four local residents, its governor said. The attack targeted the town of Tiahynka, on the Dnipro River, about 27 miles northwest of Kherson city.\n\nThe regional capital was liberated by Ukrainian forces in late 2022, who pushed invading Russian troops to the east of the Dnipro River.

The remaining $3.5 billion includes funding for credit guarantees for World Bank loans to Ukraine.\n\nKyiv announced Thursday that it had signed an agreement with the United States to help move production of arms to Ukraine, as doubts hang over Western support for its conflict with Russia.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's invasion, Ukraine has depended on Western weapons and ammunition to hold out against Russian forces.\n\nBut after nearly two years of conflict there are signs of growing weariness in Europe and the United States to provide more financial and military aid.\n\nRussian nationalist Igor Girkin, who had said he wanted to challenge Vladimir Putin in a presidential election in March, had his pre-trial detention extended for six months on Thursday, a Moscow court said.\n\nGirkin is accused of \"public calls to commit extremist activity\".\n\nRussia is ready to cooperate with China in any area, including military technology, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.\n\n\"As we think about the future, the future world order, about ensuring our security, we're letting go of the traditional 'buy and sell' relations, we're thinking about the future, thinking about technology,\" Putin, who has developed close ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping, told an investment conference.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday described the Western financial system as obsolete and said Russia, hit by Western sanctions such as disconnection from the SWIFT payments system, has proved it can overcome any challenges.\n\nSpeaking at a financial conference, Putin said \"the monopoly of large Western banks\" would come to an end in the coming years because of a technological revolution.\n\nPutin added that he hoped Russia' gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 3.5 per cent this year, as the economy rebounds from a 2.1 per cent contraction in 2022.\n\nThe Kremlin said Thursday it hoped US lawmakers would continue to block White House requests for emergency aid for Ukraine amid an internal feud in Washington over immigration reforms.\n\nRepublican senators earlier blocked $106 billion in emergency aid primarily for Ukraine and

trains on a key part of a Siberian railway near the Chinese border, on Ukraine's orders.\n\nThe arrest came around a week after authorities reported traffic complications in a tunnel on the Baikal-Amur mainline, some 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nUkrainian sources told AFP last week that Kyiv's SBU was behind the sabotage.\n\n\"On the territory of the Omsk region, a

on oil output cuts, saying they were for the good of producers and the broader global economy.\n\nPutin held a hastily-arranged meeting in Riyadh with the Saudi crown prince on Wednesday after a pledge by OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, to further cut output.\n\nHours after Putin's face-to-face talks with the Saudi crown prince, known as MbS, the Kremlin released a joint statement detailing wide-ranging talks between them on oil, OPEC+, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and even Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nIllya Kyva, a former Ukrainian MP, has been assassinated in Russia by Ukraine's SBU security service, law enforcement sources told BBC Ukraine.\n\n\"The criminal was liquidated by using small arms,\" the sources said.\n\nRussian investigators said Kyva was shot dead in the village of Suponevo, to the west of Moscow, where his body was found yesterday.\n\nEarlier this year, Kyva was handed a 14-year prison sentence for high treason after calling for Russia to occupy Ukraine. He fled to Russia one month before Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022 and was tried in absentia.\n\nThe 46-year-old politician had campaigned unsuccessfully for Ukraine's presidency in 2019.\n\nAndriy Yusov, spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence, told Ukrainian TV: \"Yes, we can confirm Kyva is no more.

As a result, two died - one of them the shooter - and there are five wounded,\" the Investigative Committee said in a statement.\n\nAuthorities did not name the shooter, but said the victim was a female classmate in the secondary school in the Bryansk suburb.\n\nRussian lawmakers on Thursday set the date of the 2024 presidential election for March 17, moving Vladimir Putin closer to a fifth term in office.\n\nPutin, 71, hasn't yet announced his intention to run again, but he is widely expected to do so in the coming days now that the date has been set.\n\nUnder constitutional reforms he orchestrated, he is eligible to seek two more six-year terms after his current one expires next year.\n\nHaving established tight control over Russia's political system, Putin's victory is all but assured. Prominent critics who could challenge him on the ballot are either in jail or living abroad, and most independent media have been banned.\n\nA driver was killed and grain infrastructure damaged by a Russian drone attack on Ukrainian grain infrastructure near the Danube River, the governor of Odesa region said on Thursday.\n\nThe governor said the drones attacked over two hours overnight, and that while most were shot down, some got through, damaging a storage building, an elevator and trucks.\n\nUkraine's Danube ports have become a key artery for the country's huge export volumes of grain as Russia blockades the Black Sea since invading its neighbour in February 2022.\n\nMoscow hit Danube port infrastructure with waves of drone attacks in August and September, but the latest overnight attack came after a lull in such strikes.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"Yahoo Sports"}, "authors"=>[],

In October, the 12th round of the China-EU High-level Strategic Dialogue was held in Beijing, the latest interaction between the two sides.\n\n\"China and the EU should uphold the apt description of their relationship as a comprehensive strategic partnership,\" Xi said at Thursday's meeting. He urged both sides to fully leverage the guiding role of the China-EU Summit and the five high-level dialogues, strengthen strategic communication, increase understanding and properly handle differences through constructive dialogue.\n\n\"We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,\" the Chinese president stressed.\n\nEchoing Xi, Michel and von der Leyen noted that the EU does not want to decouple from China. It seeks a long-term, stable, predictable and sustainable relationship with China and hopes that the China-EU Summit will help reenergize relations between the two sides.\n\nEstablished in 1998 as an annual meeting mechanism, the China-EU Summit is devoted to enhancing dialogue and cooperation between the two sides in areas including politics, economy, culture and society. The previous summit took place in April last year via video conference.\n\nAt this year's summit, the two sides also vowed to strengthen communication and coordination in multilateral fora, including the United Nations and the G20, uphold multilateralism and promote the political settlement of international and regional hotspots.\n\nChinese modernization an opportunity for EU\n\n\"As China pursues high-quality development and high-standard opening up, it sees the EU as a key partner for economic and trade cooperation, a preferred partner for scientific and technological cooperation, and a trustworthy partner for industrial and supply chain cooperation,\" Xi told the two EU leaders.\n\nChina and the EU have remained each other's second-largest trading partners. Official data shows that two-way trade amounted to $847.3 billion in 2022, or an average of over $1.6 million every minute.\n\nThis year also marks the 10th anniversary of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). During the meeting, Xi expressed China's willingness to strengthen Belt and Road cooperation, including by creating synergy between the BRI and the EU's Global Gateway.\n\nThe China-Europe Railway Express, one of the BRI flagship enterprises, provided services for 217 cities in 25 European countries with some 81,000 China-Europe freight train trips till the end of November, according to China's National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nThe EU side sees the long-term, steady growth of the Chinese economy as in the interest of Europe, said Michel and von der Leyen, who hoped the two sides would strengthen dialogue and cooperation in the economic and trade, green and digital fields, and keep supply and industrial chains stable and secure.\n\n\"Chinese modernization and European integration are strategic choices that China and Europe have made, respectively, with the future in mind,\" said Xi.\n\nThe two sides should respect and support each other and leverage the complementarity of their development strategies for common progress, he added.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"news.cgtn.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"news.cgtn.com"}, "authors"=>[],

                "body"=>"In September, Tamir Pardo, who headed the Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from 2011 to 2016, said that Israel is imposing apartheid on the Palestinians.\n\nIn August, the former Northern Commander of the Israeli army described the situation in the West Bank as one of \"total apartheid.\" In June, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and former UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson, wrapping up a trip to Israel/Palestine, highlighted the \"ever growing evidence\" they found that \"the situation meets the international legal definition of apartheid\" and highlighted that they \"heard no detailed rebuttal of the evidence of apartheid.\"\n\nPalestinians have long used the term to describe the reality of their lives under Israeli rule. Developments in recent years and the intense Israeli bombardment in Gaza in the wake of Hamas' brutal attack on Israel on October 7 has brought this question into the mainstream.\n\nApartheid is a particularly severe form of institutional discrimination and systematic oppression based on race or ethnicity, and is prohibited by international law. While apartheid was coined in relation to South Africa, international treaties, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, UN resolutions, and many countries' domestic laws define it as a universal legal term that applies globally.\n\nApartheid is also a crime against humanity, as set out both in the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the 1998Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It consists of three primary elements:\n\nUnder international law, race and racial discrimination have been interpreted to mean more than skin color or genetic traits. They refer also to distinctions based on descent and national or ethnic origin, to be evaluated on the basis of the particular context and construction by local actors.\n\nIn April 2021, after years of research, detailed case studies and a careful review of Israeli government planning documents, statements by officials and other sources, Human Rights Watch found that Israeli authorities were and are committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians, based on the Israeli government policy to maintain domination over Palestinians and grave abuses against Palestinians in the occupied territory.\n\nWe found that across Israel and the occupied territory - the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza - Israeli authorities have sought to maximize the land available for Jewish communities and minimize the number of Palestinians on that land by concentrating most Palestinians in dense population centers. In Jerusalem, for example, the government plan for the municipality explicitly refers to \"maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city\" and even specifies its target demographic ratio across West and occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nThe Netanyahu government that came to power a year ago identified as a guiding principle: \"The Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all areas of the Land of Israel,\" which the prime minister defined to include the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli authorities have also adopted policies to mitigate what they have openly described as a \"demographic threat.\" For more than two decades, they have barred, with few exceptions, granting long-term legal status inside Israel to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents, while conferring such status to spouses from virtually every other country.\n\nUnder Israeli law, a Jewish citizen of any other country who has never been to Israel can move there and automatically gain citizenship, while Palestinians expelled from their homes in what became Israel and living for more than 75 years in refugee camps in Gaza (the majority of Gaza's population are refugees) or a nearby country cannot.\n\nWe also found that Israeli authorities maintain a two-tiered legal system: methodically privileging Israelis, who have the same rights and privileges wherever they live, while repressing Palestinians to varying degrees wherever they live. As Hagai El-Ad, the former director of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, wrote, \"There is not a single square inch in the territory Israel controls where a Palestinian and a Jew are equal.\"\n\nThe oppression is most severe in the occupied territory. In the West Bank, Israel imposes harsh military rule on Palestinians while affording Jewish Israelis living in a segregated manner in the same territory their full rights under Israeli civil law.\n\nWhile many systematic abuses come together to collectively amount to apartheid, the Human Rights Watch report focused primarily on five: sweeping restrictions on movement in the form of the Gaza closure and a permit regime in the West Bank; confiscation of more than a third of the land in the West Bank; harsh conditions in parts of the West Bank that have forced thousands of Palestinians out of their homes, which amounts to forcible transfer; denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their relatives; and the suspension of basic civil rights to millions of Palestinians living under military rule.\n\nFor more than 16 years, Israeli authorities have imposed a generalized ban on travel outside of Gaza for the more than 2.2 million people living there, with few exceptions, denying them freedom of movement. They have instituted a \"policy of separation\" between the West Bank and Gaza, regularly blocking the movement of Palestinians between the two parts of the occupied territory. They have also imposed sweeping restrictions on the entry and exit of goods, which has devastated the economy in Gaza.\n\nWhile Israeli authorities continue to expand settlements in the West Bank, which violates international law, the authorities demolish hundreds of Palestinian homes and other structures every year for lacking building permits, which authorities make nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain. Between 2016 and 2018, Israeli authorities issued 100 times more demolition orders than building permits for Palestinians living in the West Bank under Israel's control.\n\nPalestinians in the West Bank hold different colored identity cards and passports than Jewish Israeli settlers, which carry with them different baskets of rights and privileges. Israeli settlers, for example, can freely move between the West Bank and Israel, while Palestinians require difficult-to-obtain permits to enter large parts of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Israel. The more than 645 checkpoints and other permanent obstacles Palestinians face can turn a short commute to school or work into an hours-long journey.\n\nMany of the abuses, such as denying building permits and demolishing homes that lack them, have no security justification. Others, such as the blanket denial of long-term legal status to Palestinians from the occupied territory married to Israeli citizens and residents, use security as a pretext to further demographic goals.\n\nEven when security forms part of the motivation, it does not justify apartheid and racial and ethnic persecution, just as torture or other unlawful actions cannot be justified in the name of security. At the same time, of course, apartheid and other abuses by Israeli authorities can never justify war crimes and other violations by armed Palestinian groups, including the killings and taking of hostages during the October 7 attacks.\n\nOur findings that Israel's oppression of Palestinians amounts to apartheid are consistent with where we found this crime against humanity in other contexts, including in Myanmar, where we found apartheid against the Rohingya, and in China against the Uyghurs. Those responsible for such crimes should be held to account, and foreign governments and businesses should end complicity in these grave abuses.\n\nThere can be no way to address or resolve the continuing crisis in Israel and Palestine, even after the current hostilities wane, without diagnosing it correctly. The discourse about the way forward needs to be based on the reality on the ground of decades of Israeli repressive rule of Palestinians. Major Israeli, Palestinian and otherinternational human rights groups have found that Israeli authorities are committing apartheid against Palestinians, as has the UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territory and many others.\n\nDenying millions of Palestinians their fundamental rights, solely because they are Palestinian, is a violation of international law, and that reality is becoming more and more clear to much of the international community.\n\nLama Fakih is Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa director and the director of the Beirut office.

                "body"=>"On November 13, Elham Farah, an elderly and much-loved music teacher from Gaza's ancient Christian minority, died from her wounds after she was shot by an Israeli sniper metres from her home, where she had returned to fetch some warmer clothes.\n\nOn 12 November, Israeli forces killed 84-year-old music teacher Elham Farah, a much-loved \"Friend, daughter, sister, aunt, teacher, musician, Christian, Palestinian, human, person\", as a family member wrote in a tribute to her published on November 18.\n\nFarah hailed from Gaza's ancient Christian community which has dwindled to under 1,000 in recent years. She had always chosen to remain in Gaza, though many Christians had fled to the West Bank since 2007 due to the repeated assaults on the besieged enclave, as well as the difficulty of movement due to Israel's stifling siege.\n\nThese restrictions on movement amounted also to curbs on the religious freedom of Palestinian Christians generated by Israel's occupation, especially during Christmas and Easter when travelling to significant sites like Bethlehem and Jerusalem is rendered near impossible.\n\nFarah was from one of the oldest Christian families in Gaza, with roots stretching back to the Ghassanid Arab period between the 4th and 7th centuries. She was also the youngest daughter of Palestinian poet Hanna Dahdah Farah.\n\n\"She would always be seen wearing her hat and glasses, carrying a purse adorned with Palestinian embroidery. She played many instruments, including the violin and the organ, but her favourite was the accordion\"\n\nMany in Gaza have voiced their grief over her death, especially her students, who point out that she was the very first music teacher in Gaza's educational system. Her neighbours in Gaza City fondly called her the \"always smiling Mrs Umm al-Orange (\"Mother Orange\" - a reference to her shock of ginger hair).\n\nFarah was full of life and strong-willed, say those who knew her. She would always be seen wearing her hat and glasses, carrying a purse adorned with Palestinian embroidery. She played many instruments, including the violin and the organ, but her favourite was the accordion.\n\nFarah's niece, Rand Markopoulos describes her aunt as \"a friend and mother; a teacher of music and life.\" Rand has lived outside Gaza for years, but she maintained contact with her aunt who lived by herself in a small apartment in the prosperous middle-class al-Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City, close to the Palestine stadium.\n\nRand said to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, The New Arab's Arabic-language sister edition: \"She was retired, and she had become elderly, but she remained the life and soul. When she was a teacher, she would play music to her students every morning, and make up melodies to go with her father's poems.\n\n\"She had survived all the previous Israeli assaults on the Gaza Strip and described the current one as the worst she'd ever experienced. For a month, she sought shelter from the bombing with hundreds of others in the Holy Family Catholic Church, one of the two churches that had opened their doors as shelters for the displaced. However, on her final day, she left the church to breathe some fresh air, pick up some clothes, and check on her home. She would always say God would protect her.\"\n\nOn November 12 Farah walked out of the church and headed for her apartment on foot. As she was arriving, an Israeli sniper positioned on a nearby roof shot her in the leg.\n\nOnce her neighbours realised what had happened, they tried frantically to reach her to administer basic aid, but the sniper rained bullets down on everyone who tried to approach her.\n\nThey managed to inform her family, and her niece was finally able to get through to her. In the tribute mentioned above, her relative writes: \"In that conversation, Elham described the severe pain she was experiencing and said that she'd been calling for help for hours without any aid. She expressed that she could no longer feel her leg thinking that it had been amputated from the rest of her body. Her niece told her, 'Auntie Elham if it were amputated you would have bled to death by now. Rest your head. It is getting dark. We will try to get someone to you by the morning.' Elham responded, 'Okay, I just put my head on the sidewalk. I will be waiting here.'\"\n\n\"She was born in Gaza, and may she rest there eternally\"\n\nHowever, repeated and desperate attempts to find an ambulance able to reach Elham were unsuccessful despite the family managing to get hold of the Red Cross. The elderly music teacher took her last breath on November 13, 2023.\n\n\"We have lost a beautiful soul,\" said Rand, adding, \"She was born in Gaza, and may she rest there eternally. We will never forget the sound of her playing the accordion. She would play it with so much love. She loved Gaza and gave so much to everyone. She used to play in church on religious occasions, and she looked after herself in her little apartment until the end of her days.\"\n\nFarah had lived near her friends and relatives in al-Rimal but had worked in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood, where the only music school in the Gaza Strip could be found, close by the offices of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. The school would hold many concerts, and Farah would always be eager to attend them and would play with musical groups at them, as at the Christian Youth Association in al-Rimal.\n\nOsama Al Ashi (29) one of her neighbours, expresses his sorrow at her death and confirms that he will never forget her always-smiling face.\n\n\"She would participate in everyone's special occasions - she would play for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and she'd play during Ramadan. She always wanted to make the children happy by playing all the traditional songs and nasheeds (a type of Islamic song or chant played with or without instrumental accompaniment) associated with Ramadan.\n\nShe'd also practice every night between 8 and 10 pm. We didn't complain because it would fill her with happiness, and her music was nice to listen to. She was well-known as a music teacher at the Latin Patriarchate School in the old part of Gaza City, and she'd previously survived the attack on Saint Porphyrius Church by the occupation.\"\n\nHer student Yara Musallam (32) played the violin and the piano with many music groups, and took part in national events, and says she gives credit to Farah for this, as she was the one who taught her to play. Even though there were some restrictions placed on girls in Gaza when it came to playing in bands and concerts, she kept playing at home and in the school where she works.\n\nMusallam also taught at the Latin Patriarchate School at primary and intermediate levels and has played the violin with musical ensembles in both Egypt and Amman.\n\nShe says she bumped into her teacher Farah three years ago and was surprised to find Farah still remembered her. Farah responded: \"I still remember faces even though I've become old. I remember her as the loveliest and kindest teacher. Whenever I was playing I remember how she would look at me lovingly. She would say to me: 'Play with love because you are strong. I was shy when I was small.'\n\n\"Israel killed my beautiful teacher. Maybe many of her students are no longer in Gaza, but her love is a bond between us.\"\n\nThis is an edited translation with additional reporting.

                "body"=>"Germany has tried to make amends for its Nazi past by backing Israel, in what some experts say is an attempt to whitewash its international image.\n\nOn November 14, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made another argument in defence of Israel.\n\n\"Israel is a democracy - this has to be said very clearly,\" Scholz said in response to a comment by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said Israel's legitimacy was \"being questioned due to its own fascism\".\n\n\"There is no doubt about this,\" said the German leader. \"And we will emphasise in every conversation and at every opportunity that this is our view.\"\n\nAt the time of Scholz's remarks, more than 11,100 Palestinians had been killed by the Israeli military, which began its latest campaign in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive in the Hamas attacks.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza had surpassed 17,000 people.\n\nScholz's comments were no mere political observation.\n\nThe modern German republic, which, for generations, has tried to make amends for its Nazi past and its role in the Holocaust during the second world war, has long made Israel's security its Staatsräson (\"reason of state\") - a term first coined in an essay by Germany's former ambassador to Israel, Rudolf Dreßler, in the early 2000s.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza, which has been raging for more than 60 days, has only hardened German political support for the Israeli state.\n\nOn Tuesday, officials from Saxony-Anhalt announced that applicants seeking naturalisation in the east German state would have to commit to Israel's \"right to exist\" in writing, or face being refused German citizenship.\n\nThis followed weeks of reports that German authorities are cracking down on shows of support for Gaza in this current conflict.\n\nAcademic Daniel Marwecki, author of, Germany and Israel: Whitewashing and State Building, told Al Jazeera that \"when German politicians today talk about Israel they [do so] from a moral standpoint\".\n\n\"All the leading German politicians think [that defending Israel] is morally the right thing to do because of the German past,\" he added.\n\nThe history of ties between Germany and Israel dates back to 1948 when the Israeli state was established, following the end of the British mandate in Palestine.\n\nMarwecki, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Hong Kong, said that a German determination to \"whitewash\" its international image in the wake of the Holocaust informed its post-war approach to Israel.\n\nThis included West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's agreement to pay Israel post-Holocaust reparations in the form of goods and services in 1952, as the fledgling state attempted to grow its economy.\n\nIn 1965, West Germany and Israel established formal diplomatic ties.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 - and the end of the Cold War - a reunified Germany pursued a twin-track approach to engaging with its past where its relationship with Israel, said Marwecki, proved pivotal.\n\nThis approach, he said, focused \"German memory culture ... more and more on the Holocaust and anti-Semitism\", while Berlin looked to buttress its role as a mainstream European power in lockstep with the United States.\n\nToday, the German Federation is the largest economy in Europe and the fourth-largest economy in the world.\n\nBut not everyone in Germany backs the commitment to Staatsräson.\n\nAdvocates of Palestine in Germany say that support of Israel has gone hand-in-hand with a relentless campaign to silence pro-Palestinian voices.\n\nExamples of this, according to activists, have been numerous. In 2019, for instance, the German Bundestag passed a motion labelling the non-violent anti-Israeli Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement anti-Semitic.\n\nAnd three years later, the state-funded Society for a Democratic Culture in Berlin (VDK) was forced by a German court to release a secret dossier that had framed German-Palestinian academic Anna Younes as an anti-Smite and terrorist sympathiser, using data gathered as far back as 2014.\n\nYounes, having already endured much emotional turmoil during this and, she said, many other \"misinformation episodes\", told Al Jazeera that Germany's unwavering support for Israel's relentless shelling of the Strip has left her \"utterly speechless\".\n\n\"You're constantly gaslit in this country,\" said Younes, of what she calls a long-established attempt by the German state to delegitimise domestic support for Palestine. \"My demoralised attitude springs from living through this for such a long time.\"\n\nYounes was born and brought up in east Berlin \"right next to the wall\".\n\nShe said Germany's support \"for the genocide in Gaza\" has only served to show that \"Palestinian lives ... Muslim lives, Arab lives and non-white lives in Europe and the Middle East\" are expendable.\n\n\"This is the message that we are getting from the powerful,\" added Younes, who said that nothing could dissuade her from \"speaking up\" for the rights of Palestinians.\n\nLast month, a German opinion poll revealed that only 31 percent of respondents backed Scholz's uncompromising support for the Israeli military bombardment of Gaza.\n\nAnd even those who stand with Israel refuse to ignore Palestinian suffering.\n\nOne German national, Carsten, who attended a pro-Israel rally in Berlin following the events of October 7, said while \"Israel's right to exist and ... defend itself [was] non-negotiable ... almost everyone has significant concerns about a lot of Israel's policies\".\n\nThe music business manager, who did not want his full name published, explained that \"almost every German has ancestors or relatives who were in some shape or form involved in the slaughter of six million Jews\".\n\nKilling innocent civilians on both sides is \"clearly wrong\", he told Al Jazeera. \"If people pick sides, no matter what actions 'their side' takes, we are doomed to gridlock, further sorrow and despair.\"", "source"=>{"uri"=>"aljazeera.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors"=>[],

                "body"=>"Concept is increasingly accepted in academia but is not a distinct crime against humanity under international law\n\nThe destruction of more than a third of Gaza's homes as Israel bombards the territory in pursuit of Hamas is leading international legal experts to raise the concept of \"domicide\" - the mass destruction of dwellings to make the territory uninhabitable.\n\nIn the current Gaza war, launched after the 7 October attack by Hamas on southern Israel, independent experts estimate that as much as 40% of the housing in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed. The UN says 1.8 million people are internally displaced inside Gaza, many living in overcrowded UN shelters in the south.\n\nAlthough Gaza has been damaged in previous conflicts and rebuilt, largely with money from the Gulf states, the current scale of the devastation is of a different order.\n\nAt issue is whether the scale of the infrastructure damage is a byproduct of the search for Hamas or part of a covert plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza, erasing the possibility of Gaza becoming a semi-viable society in the foreseeable future.\n\nDomicide, a concept increasingly accepted in academia, is not a distinct crime against humanity under international law, and the UN special rapporteur on the right to housing tabled a report to the UN in October last year arguing that \"a very important protection gap\" needed to be filled.\n\nThe destruction of homes in Aleppo in the Syrian civil war, the flattening of Rohingya settlements in Myanmar and the destruction of Mariupol in Ukraine have in recent years increased focus on the issue.\n\n\"It is necessary to address hostilities being carried out in the knowledge that they will systematically destroy and damage civilian housing and infrastructure, rendering an entire city - such as Gaza City - uninhabitable for civilians,\" the UN rapporteur, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, a law professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, told the Guardian.\n\nRajagopal argues that a gap exists in international law since while the protection of civilian homes is covered by the Rome statute establishing the international criminal court in relation to war crimes in conflicts between states, it is not listed as among the crimes against humanity that could take place in a conflict within a state or involving non-state actors.\n\n\"This is relevant to the mass destruction of housing in the case of the Israel-Palestinian conflict in Gaza,\" Rajagopal said. \"Israel will say the conflict is not an international armed conflict because Israel does not recognise Palestine as a state.\"\n\nHe argued that most of the conflicts where the most deaths have occurred since the second world war have been non-international armed conflicts, with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine an exception rather than the rule.\n\nHe said a similar gap in relation to starvation had just been filled. The Rome statute had listed starvation as a war crime but not a crime against humanity, so exempting non-state actors. Switzerland pressed to amend the statute to make starvation a crime against humanity, a change finally implemented in 2022.\n\nRajagopal said: \"I would appeal to these countries that oppose what is happening in Gaza, such as South Africa and Spain, to do exactly what they did with regard to starvation to address the protection gap [and] make sure the mass destruction of housing in Gaza can be prosecuted.\"\n\nHe added that on the basis of the facts and remarks made by Israeli leaders, he believed the purpose of the destruction on this scale was not simply to eliminate Hamas but to make Gaza uninhabitable.\n\nIsrael says all damage to buildings and loss of civilian life is regrettable but made necessary by Hamas deliberately hiding in schools and hospitals and by its refusal to surrender. It says it is making every effort to warn citizens of imminent attacks.\n\nEstimates of the level of destruction of Gaza's buildings are contentious but new use of satellite imagery suggests that 98,000 buildings had been damaged as of 29 November, the start of the now abandoned temporary ceasefire.\n\nThe findings were based on analysis of European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data by Corey Scher of the City University of New York and Jamon van den Hoek of Oregon State University. Their work has been repeatedly cited by news organisations ranging from the BBC to the Washington Post, reflecting the difficulty reporters have in mapping the true scale of the bombing.\n\nRather than using optical images, the assessment relies on publicly available satellite radar data and a specifically developed algorithm to measure the stability of the built environment to infer building damage. It has the advantage of looking at structures from oblique angles and not just overhead.\n\nThe imagery moving north to south showed 47% to 59% damage between 7 October and 22 November in northern Gaza, 47-58% damage in Gaza City, 11-16% in Deir al-Balah, 10-15% in Khan Younis and 7-11% in Rafah, the area closest to the border with Egypt. This amounts to between 67,000 and 88,000 buildings, meaning roughly 70% of buildings remain undamaged. The figure for Khan Younis will have risen since the end of the ceasefire and the concentration of Israeli military activity in the south.\n\nAmong the buildings destroyed or partially destroyed are the main Palestinian court in Gaza, known as the Justice Palace, the Palestinian Legislative Council complex, 339 education facilities and 167 places of worship, while 26 of the territory's 35 hospitals are not functioning.\n\nHugh Lovatt, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, suggested Israel was \"deliberately and methodically destroying the civil institutions and infrastructure that will be needed to govern and stabilise post-conflict Gaza\".\n\nSatellite imagery also reveals the destruction of orchards, greenhouses and farmland in northern Gaza. Human Rights Watch said on Monday: \"In north-east Gaza, north of Beit Hanoun, once green agricultural land is now brown and desolate. Fields and orchards were first damaged during hostilities following Israel's ground invasion in late October. Bulldozers carved new roads, clearing the way for Israeli military vehicles.\"\n\nLeaks from inside the Israeli government, including the intelligence ministry, show officials have been examining ways to force Palestinians to leave Gaza, either voluntarily or forcibly. The intelligence ministry is not a high-status body in the government, but US conservatives such as John Bolton, the former national security adviser, have canvassed variations of such plans.\n\nGiora Eiland, a former head of the Israeli national security council, wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper: \"The state of Israel has no choice but to turn Gaza into a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in. Creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the goal ... Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.\"\n\nThe US has repeatedly ruled out such a policy, partly because it knows two allies, Jordan and Egypt, will not welcome more refugees into their countries, even on a temporary basis.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"theguardian.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"The Guardian"}, "authors"=>[{"uri"=>"patrick_wintour@theguardian.com", "name"=>"Patrick Wintour", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}],

                "body"=>"Taylor Swift is Time Magazine's Person of the Year, a choice that makes perfect sense. Swift's Eras Tour is on track to break global records for tour earnings. A concert film also smashed records for that genre and provided the AMC movie theater chain with its highest single-day ticket sales ever. She was Spotify's most-streamed artist globally for 2023, following three years in which Bad Bunny took that title. Swift's romance with NFL player Travis Kelce has increased ratings for Kansas City Chiefs football games while sales of his jersey spiked by 400%. She is as dominant a figure as they come these days -- exactly what Time's Person of the Year is supposed to recognize.\n\nProminent far-right influencers are very unhappy. \"And just like clockwork, @taylorswift13 (as I warned you all about) is being further activated by the media and the Democrats to interfere in the 2024 election,\" Laura Loomer tweeted, tying it back to her earlier just-asking-questions conspiracy theory: \"Has @taylorswift13 made a deal with George Soros and Alex Soros to get the rights to her music back in exchange for getting Zoomers registered to vote Democrat against President Trump ahead of the 2024 Presidential election?\" (This is a particularly odd theory given that Swift has spent years rerecording her early albums to reclaim ownership.)\n\nPizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec also weighed in. \"The Taylor Swift girlboss psyop has been fully activated. From her hand-selected vaccine shill boyfriend to her DINK lifestyle to her upcoming 2024 voter operation for Democrats on abortion rights,\" he tweeted. \"It's all coming.\"\n\nPosobiec also offered up the Soros conspiracy theory: \"Thinking about when Taylor Swift called out the Soros family in 2019 for buying the rights to her music and then how she came out a super liberal in 2020.\"\n\nTime's person of the year interview with Swift makes clear just how ridiculous this idea is of her as a Soros puppet -- or anyone's puppet. Swift is forceful and direct. She is very much a person who knows her own mind and is charting her own course. Again, this is someone who responded to the loss of control of her artistic product by rerecording it over a period of years while continuing to put out new music and then launching one of the biggest, if not the biggest, tours of all time.\n\nIn the interview, Swift models support for other highly successful women in entertainment, refusing to be drawn into competition. She described her tour, Beyoncé's tour, and Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie\" movie as \"a three-part summer of feminine extravaganza.\" She praises both Gerwig and Beyoncé, in particular the latter:\n\n\"She's the most precious gem of a person -- warm and open and funny,\" Swift says. \"And she's such a great disrupter of music-industry norms. She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.\" That her tour and Beyoncé's were frequently juxtaposed is vexing. \"There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,\" she says. \"Clearly it's very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.\"\n\nSwift even offered an analysis of how gender is at play in the economics of popular culture. This is not some blank slate being \"activated\" by the media/Democrats/Soros. She's not just a singer and performer: She's a songwriter and a major entrepreneur. At just 33 years old, she's been navigating fame for more than 15 years. In that time has she learned an enormous amount about how the public responds to what she says and does.\n\nTake her relationship with Kelce, another target of right-wing rage. Before the relationship went public, she told Time, \"we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\" This is someone who has from a very early age had to see every detail of her life through the filter of how it might be reported and how her fans and haters might react. If she didn't have an enormous amount of self-knowledge, she would not be the star she is, because she would have crashed and burned.\n\nPeople like Posobiec and Loomer, who look at everything as a conspiracy, look at Swift and see only a conventionally attractive young woman and pop star and simply cannot wrap their heads around any of that. But even if you're not especially a Swift fan (here I raise my hand), any assessment of her that's grounded in reality has to acknowledge her intelligence and independence.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"crooksandliars.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"Crooks and Liars"}, "authors"=>[{"uri"=>"laura_clawson@crooksandliars.com", "name"=>"Laura Clawson", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}],

                "body"=>"Australian authorities were preparing to close the border between the country's two largest states, as the country's second-largest city, Melbourne, recorded two deaths and its highest-ever daily increase in infections on Monday.\n\nThe border between the states of New South Wales -- home to Sydney -- and Victoria -- home to Melbourne -- is due to be shut late Tuesday.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian was a critic of states that closed their borders to her state when Sydney had Australia's largest number of coronavirus cases. But she said she changed her stance because the situation in Melbourne was unprecedented and indicated the pandemic was in a new phase.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of new infections detected in Melbourne in recent weeks were from community transmission. Everywhere else in Australia, the vast majority of people who tested positive for the virus were infected overseas or had been infected by a returned traveler, Berejiklian said.\n\n\"What is occurring in Victoria has not yet occurred anywhere else in Australia,\" she said Monday. \"It's a new part of the pandemic and, as such, it requires a new type of response.\"\n\nThe Victorian government locked down 36 of the most virus-prone Melbourne suburbs last week and at the weekend added another four suburbs because of the disease spread.\n\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews said of the 127 new cases recorded overnight, 53 were among 3,000 people who have been confined by police to their apartments in nine public housing blocks since Saturday.\n\nAustralia's Acting Chief Medical Officer Paulk Kelly has described the high-rises as \"vertical cruise ships\" because of the high risk of virus spread.\n\nPolice allege a 32-year-old man bit a police officer on Monday as he attempted to leave a high-rise in the suburb of Flemington. He would be charged with assault, resisting police and attempting to breach a pandemic order, Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said.\n\nThe infections announced Monday surpassed the first surge of infections in Melbourne that peaked on March 28 at 111 cases recorded in a day.\n\nDaniels said he agreed with Berejiklian and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a Sydney resident, that the border needed to close. Three in five Australian residents live in Sydney or Melbourne and the air services between the two cities before the pandemic were among the busiest in the world.\n\n\"I think it is the smart call, the right call at this time, given the significant challenges we face in containing this virus,\" Andrews said.\n\nDeputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd confirmed that federal authorities agreed with the closure. The federal government had previously opposed any internal border closures aimed mostly at stopping spread from Victoria and New South Wales. Morrison had urged state leaders to open their borders for the good of the economy.\n\nKidd said that only 16% of new cases detected in Australia in the past week had been infected overseas. Two weeks ago, 50% of new cases were people infected overseas and detected in hotel quarantine, he said.\n\n\"The situation in Melbourne has come as a jolt, not just of the people of Melbourne but people right across Australia who may have thought that this was all behind us. It is not,\" Kidd said.\n\nOutside of Victoria, another 13 cases reported in the past 24 hours were people infected overseas. Of those, 10 had been in hotel quarantine in New South Wales and three in Western Australia\n\nNew South Wales police will enforce the Victorian border closure. Some flights and trains services would continue for travelers who are given permits and exemptions, Berejiklian said.\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said officers would use drones to detect people who attempt across the border via forest tracks to avoid the 55 policed road and bridge crossings.\n\nNationwide, Australia has recorded more than 8,500 total infections and 106 deaths.\n\n_____\n\nMcGuirk contributed to this report from Canberra Australia.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors"=>[],

Denmark's parliament on Thursday adopted a law criminalising the \"inappropriate treatment\" of religious texts, effectively banning Koran burnings after a series of desecrations of Islam's holy book sparked anger in Muslim countries over the summer.\n\nThe bill, which prohibits \"inappropriate treatment of writings with significant religious importance for a recognised religious community\", was passed with 94 votes in favour and 77 opposed in the 179-seat Folketing.\n\n\"We must protect the security of Denmark and the Danes. Therefore, it is important that we now have better protection against the systematic insults we have seen for a long time,\" Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said in a statement.\n\nIn practical terms, it will be forbidden to burn, tear or otherwise defile holy texts publicly or in videos intended to be disseminated widely.\n\nThose who break the law, which will be evaluated after three years, risk a fine or up to two years in prison.\n\nOver the summer, Denmark and neighbouring Sweden became the focus of anger across several Muslim countries after a slew of protests involving burnings and desecrations of the Koran.\n\nNearly a thousand protesters attempted to march to the Danish embassy in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone in late July following a call by firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr.\n\nIn response to the worsened security situation, the Scandinavian country temporarily tightened border controls, but returned to normal on August 22.\n\nBetween July 21 and October 24 this year, 483 book burnings or flag burnings were recorded in Denmark, according to national police figures.\n\nCriticism\n\nInitially announced at the end of August, the bill was amended following criticism that its first draft limited freedom of expression and would be difficult to enforce.\n\nIt was originally planned to cover objects of significant religious importance.\n\nThe first draft was also criticised by some -- including politicians, artists, media and freedom of speech experts -- as a return to a blasphemy law that Denmark abolished in 2017.\n\nDuring a lengthy debate in parliament ahead of the vote, opposition lawmakers railed against the government, accusing it of sacrificing freedom of expression.\n\n\"It is a betrayal. A huge failure on the part of the government,\" Inger Stojberg, leader of far-right Denmark Democrats, told parliament.\n\nIn 2006, a wave of anti-Danish anger and violence erupted in the Muslim world following the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.\n\n\"Imagine that we are becoming the generation that curtailed freedom of speech. I hadn't actually thought this would be -- and certainly not after the Muhammad crisis. Back then, we stood firm,\" Stojberg said.\n\nIn neighbouring Sweden, the government has condemned desecrations of the Koran at protests while upholding the country's constitutionally protected freedom of speech and assembly laws.\n\nIt has vowed to explore legal means of stopping protests involving the burning of holy texts in certain circumstances.\n\nDenmark is not the only European country to have banned burnings of the Koran.\n\nAccording to Denmark's justice ministry, eight European countries -- Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania -- do so to varying degrees.\n\nIn Greece, for example, the burning of a sacred text can be banned if the act takes place in or near a religious site.

                "body"=>"NEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump returned to his civil business fraud trial as a spectator Thursday, after a month of assailing the proceedings from afar.\n\nWith testimony winding down after more than two months, the Republican 2024 presidential front-runner showed up to watch an accounting professor testify about financial topics important to the case.\n\nTrump himself is scheduled to take the stand Monday, for a second time.\n\nEven while campaigning to reclaim the presidency and fighting four criminal cases, Trump is devoting a lot of attention to the New York lawsuit. He's been a frustrated onlooker, a confrontational witness and a heated commentator outside the courtroom door.\n\n\"This is a witch hunt, and it's a very corrupt trial,\" Trump said on his way into court Thursday.\n\nThe case is putting his net worth on trial, scrutinizing the real estate empire that first built his reputation, and threatening to block him from doing business in his native state.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James' suit accuses Trump, his company and some executives of misleading banks and insurers by giving them financial statements full of inflated values for such signature assets as his Trump Tower penthouse and Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he now lives. The statements were provided to help secure deals -- including loans at attractive interest rates available to hyperwealthy people -- and some loans required updated statements each year.\n\nTrump denies any wrongdoing, and he posits that the statements' numbers actually fell short of his wealth. He also has downplayed the documents' importance in getting deals, saying it was clear that lenders and others should do their own analyses. And he claims the case is a partisan abuse of power by James and Judge Arthur Engoron, both Democrats.\n\nThursday's witness, New York University accounting professor Eli Bartov, appeared for Trump's defense.\n\nIn a report prepared before his testimony, Bartov disputed the attorney general's allegations that Trump's financial statements flouted basic accounting rules. The professor added that in the accounting and financial world, recipients see such statements as just a starting point for doing their own analyses.\n\nTrump has regularly railed about the case on his Truth Social platform.\n\nGoing to court in person affords him a microphone -- in fact, many of them, on the news cameras positioned in the hallway. He often stops on his way into and out of the proceedings, which cameras can't record, to expostulate and to cast various developments as victories.\n\nHis out-of-court remarks got him fined $10,000 Oct. 26, when Engoron decided Trump had violated a gag order that prohibits participants in the trial from commenting publicly on court staffers. Trump's lawyers are appealing the gag order.\n\nJames hasn't let Trump go unanswered, often -- but not Thursday -- showing up to court herself when he's there and making her own comments on social media and the courthouse steps. Lawyers in the case have been told not to make press statements in the hallway, but the former president has been allowed to do so.\n\n\"Here's a fact: Donald Trump has engaged in years of financial fraud. Here's another fact: When you break the law, there are consequences,\" her office wrote this week on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhile the non-jury trial is airing claims of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records, Engoron ruled beforehand that Trump and other defendants engaged in fraud. He ordered that a receiver take control of some of Trump's properties, but an appeals court has held off on that order for now.\n\nAt trial, James is seeking more than $300 million in penalties and a prohibition on Trump and other defendants doing business in New York.\n\nIt's not clear exactly when testimony will wrap up, but it's expected before Christmas. Closing arguments are scheduled in January, and Engoron is aiming for a decision by the end of that month.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"register-herald.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors"=>[{"uri"=>"associated_press@register-herald.com", "name"=>"Associated Press", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}, {"uri"=>"michael_r_sisak@register-herald.com", "name"=>"Michael R.

                "body"=>"Maureen Dowd of The New York Times writes of a Twilight Zone episode (nyti.ms/413XeOe) in which aliens who have recently landed on earth give world leaders a book to signal their intention for peace and cooperation. Earth's experts work hard to translate its alien language and are relieved when they interpret the book title as 'To Serve Man.' They welcome the aliens, but soon realize that the book is actually a cookbook!\n\nThe OpenAI board must have been watching this episode when it suddenly and inexplicably decided to dismiss the company's charismatic founder-CEO Sam Altman in a half-hour of frenzied activity. The reverberations felt around the planet were like an alien landing's, as the tech world and journalists tried to make sense out of this unexpected ouster. The board gave a cryptic reason that Altman was not \"consistently candid in his communications with the board,\" but clammed up afterwards. Various theories started floating in this vacuum. There were whispers about Altman \"lying to the board.\" Observers felt that he would have done something grossly inappropriate, but that was promptly refused by the board and OpenAI's chief scientist. Another outrageous theory was that Sam and team had actually discovered AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and the board was shaken by the implications, leading to Altman's instant dismissal; a new development called Q Star (sounding dangerously like QAnon) was named as that AGI! There were also some dark mumblings of household trouble in the Altman family, and even conspiracy theories that Microsoft was behind the action in a plot to gain more control.\n\nIn fact, no one was more shocked than Microsoft and its charismatic CEO Satya Nadella. He and his company had gone all-in with Altman and OpenAI to develop the next generation of its software productivity products called Copilots. The real reason for the abrupt decision was revealed soon, though: internal boardroom intrigue. One of its members, Helen Toner, had co-written a paper that seemed to pan OpenAI for \"stoking the flames of AI hype.\" Altman was miffed, and, besides remonstrating with Toner, allegedly started rallying other board members to remove her. However, four of the board's members (excluding him and another co-founder Greg Brockman) joined ranks and decided to remove Altman instead. A surprising member of this quad was Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder and a friend of Altman. Reports suggest that Sutskever, who was a purist as far as AI research and development goes, was worried about the pace and direction of OpenAI's product launches and had privately and publicly warned against it.\n\nThe rest is well known: Altman was back as CEO in five days, not least due to a masterstroke played by Microsoft to hire him and extend an open offer to the rest of OpenAI's 700 employees, with 95% of them threatening to accept it. What is more significant is how this will likely play out going forward. The story here is about a much more existentialist question on how this powerful technology ought to be developed.\n\nOpenAI's old board claimed to be acting on behalf of 'humanity,' and was said to be worried about AGI and safety. Ranged against it were the powerful commercial instincts of value-creation and profits. OpenAI was deliberately structured unconventionally, with its board empowered to act if its members felt that humanity was in danger. But their gambit failed.\n\nIn many ways, this is a familiar story and I have often written about this. The problem is usually never the technology but the business model. Data-monetization as a business model has sunk social networks into the morass they are in, with X's owner Elon Musk railing against advertisers who seem to be \"blackmailing\" him and his noble intentions for X. Google succumbed to 'the innovator's dilemma' as it was afraid that the large language models of AI it had worked on could hurt its lucrative search business model. So will it be for Generative AI and OpenAI. The company twisted itself into a pretzel-like corporate structure, enabling it to raise billions of dollars from Microsoft and attain a valuation placed at $86 billion, while simultaneously claiming to build AGI for the good of humanity and not necessarily for economic gain. These divergent forces could not be sustained forever and the pretzel model broke down when the strain grew too severe. The outcome was clear: capitalistic business models had won over the quest for pure societal good. The aliens are already among us, it would seem, and humanity should be worried.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"livemint.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"mint"}, "authors"=>[{"uri"=>"jaspreet_bindra@livemint.com", "name"=>"Jaspreet Bindra", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}],

                "body"=>"Journalists must give a voice to the underrepresented and underprivileged communities at the receiving end of much of the misinformation that drives polarising narratives and undermines trust in democracy itself, Meera Selva writes.\n\n2024 is going to be the year of elections driven by AI-boosted campaigning, global conflict, and ever more pervasive AI tools.\n\nSome 2 billion people will go to the polls in 65 elections to select leaders who will have campaigned, communicated, and fundraised online, and who know their terms in office will be defined by the digital space.\n\nVoting will happen in some of the most densely populated countries in the world, where media has been upended by digital communications, including Indonesia, India, and Mexico.\n\nAnd these elections will be among the first to take place after the sudden popularisation of generative AI technologies -- casting further uncertainty on how they will play out.\n\nThere is an argument that fears of AI are overblown, and most people will not have their behaviour altered by exposure to AI-generated misinformation. 2024 will offer some evidence as to whether or not that's true.\n\nSmall groups will play big roles. Elections are now often so closely contested that the final results can be turned by proportionately very few voters.\n\nMistrust or hostility towards one small group can end up defining the whole national debate. Communities of colour and immigrant communities can be affected disproportionately by misinformation in election times, by both conspiracy theories undermining their trust in the process, and incorrect information on how to vote.\n\nThat is why the needs and voices of minority communities must be foregrounded in these elections. Whether AI tools will help or hinder that is still an open question.\n\nSome of the biggest dangers widely accessible AI technologies will pose in global elections stem from a lack of diversity in design and leadership.\n\nThere is already a trend for misinformation to spread via mistranslations -- words that have different, often more negative connotations when translated from one language, usually English, to another.\n\nThis will only worsen with AI-powered translations done at speed without editorial checks or oversight from native language speakers.\n\nSome AI tools also play on existing prejudices against minorities: in Slovakia's elections this autumn, an alleged audio recording of one candidate telling a journalist about a plan to buy votes from the Roma minority, who are structurally discriminated against and often viewed with hostility, spread fast on Facebook.\n\nThe truth that the recording had been altered came too late: the candidate in question, Michal Simecka, lost to former Prime Minister Robert Fico, who returned to power after having resigned in 2018 following outrage over the murder of an investigative journalist.\n\nIn India, there are fears that popular AI tools are entrenching existing discrimination on lines of caste, religion and ethnicity.\n\nDuring communal riots in Delhi in 2020, police used AI-powered facial recognition technology to arrest rioters. Critics point out the technology is more likely to be used against Muslims, indigenous communities, and those from the Dalit caste as the country's elections draw near.\n\nThese fears are backed up by research from Queens University in Belfast, which showed other ways that the use of AI in election processes can harm minorities.\n\nIf the technology is used for administering mailing lists or deciding where polling stations should be located, there is a real risk that this will result in minority groups being ignored or badly served.\n\nMany of the problems of diversity in AI-generated content come from the data sets the technology is trained on, but the demographics of AI teams are also a factor.\n\nA McKinsey report on the state of AI in 2022 shows that women are significantly underrepresented, and a shocking 29% of respondents said they have no minority employees working on their AI solutions.\n\nAs AI researcher Dr Sasha Luccioni recently pointed out, women are even excluded from the way AI is reported on.\n\nIt's clear AI will play a significant role in next year's elections. Much of it will be beneficial: it can be used to power chatbots to engage citizens in political processes and can help candidates understand messages from the campaign trail more easily.\n\nI see this first-hand in my daily work: Internews partners up with local, independent media outlets around the world that are creatively using AI tools to improve the public's access to good information.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the Center for Innovation and Technology is using an AI-generated avatar as a real-time newsreader, which can have its speech tailored to local accents and dialects, reaching communities that are rarely represented in newsrooms.\n\nAnd elsewhere in Africa, newsrooms are using AI tools to detect bias and discrimination in their stories.\n\nThe same AI tools will almost certainly be used by malicious actors to generate deep fakes, fuel misinformation, and distort public debate at warp speed.\n\nThe Philippines, for example, has had its political discourse upended by social media, to the extent that its most famous editor, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Maria Ressa, warned that the Philippines is the canary in a coal mine on the interface of technology, communications, and democracy; anything that happens there will happen in the rest of the world within a few years.\n\nThere is pushback however and Filipino society is taking action -- ahead of next year's elections, media organizations and civil society have come together to create ethical AI frameworks as a starting point for how journalists can use this new technology responsibly.\n\nBut these kinds of initiatives are only part of the solution. Journalism alone cannot solve the problems posed by generative and program AI in elections, in the same way, it cannot solve the problems of mis and disinformation.\n\nThis is an issue regulators, technology companies, and electoral commissions must work on alongside civil society groups -- but that alone also won't suffice.\n\nIt is vital that journalists give a voice to the underrepresented and underprivileged communities at the receiving end of much of the misinformation that drives polarising narratives and undermines trust in elections, and ultimately in democracy itself.\n\nWe didn't pay enough attention to underserved communities and minority groups when social media first upended electoral processes worldwide, contributing to the democratic backsliding and division we see today. Let us not make the same mistake twice.\n\nMeera Selva is the Europe CEO of Internews, a global nonprofit supporting independent media in 100+ countries.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"euronews.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"Euronews English"}, "authors"=>[],

                "body"=>"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israeli forces struck the southern Gaza town of Rafah twice, residents said Thursday, sowing fear in one of the last places where civilians have sought refuge after Israel widened its offensive against Hamas to areas already packed with displaced people.\n\nUnited Nations officials say there are no safe places in Gaza. Heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis has displaced tens of thousands of people and cut most of Gaza off from deliveries of food, water and other vital aid. More than 80% of the territory's population has already fled their homes.\n\nTwo months into the war, the grinding offensive has set off renewed alarms internationally, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres using a rarely exercised power to warn the Security Council of an impending \"humanitarian catastrophe\" and urging members to demand a cease-fire.\n\nThe United States has called on Israel to limit civilian deaths and displacement, saying too many Palestinians were killed when it obliterated much of Gaza City and the north. But the U.S. has also pledged unwavering support for Israel and appears likely to block any U.N. effort to halt the fighting.\n\nIsrael says it must crush Hamas' military capabilities and remove it from power following the Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war. Troops have pushed into Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli officials have portrayed as Hamas' center of gravity -- something they previously said was in Gaza City and its Shifa Hospital.\n\nIsrael has ordered the evacuation of some two dozen southern neighborhoods, rather than the entire region as it did in the north, which the military says shows increased concern for civilians.\n\nBut the areas where Palestinians can seek safety are rapidly receding. With northern and central Gaza largely isolated and cut off from aid, Palestinians are heading south to Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt, where family homes are packed tight and makeshift shelters are overflowing.\n\nEven there, safety has proven elusive, as Israel continues to strike what it says are Hamas targets across the coastal enclave.\n\nA strike late Wednesday leveled a home in Rafah, sending a wave of wounded streaming into a nearby hospital. Eyad al-Hobi, who witnessed the attack, said around 20 people were killed, including women and children. Another house was hit early Thursday, residents said.\n\n\"We live in fear every moment, for our children, ourselves, our families,\" said Dalia Abu Samhadaneh, now living in Rafah with her family after fleeing Khan Younis. \"We live with the anxiety of expulsion.\"\n\nThe military accused militants of firing rockets from open areas near Rafah in the humanitarian zone. It released footage of a strike Wednesday on what it said were launchers positioned outside the town and a few hundred meters (yards) from a U.N. warehouse.\n\nBATTLES IN NORTH AND SOUTH\n\nThe U.N. says some 1.87 million people -- over 80% of the population of 2.3 million -- have already fled their homes, many of them displaced multiple times.\n\nIsrael's campaign has killed more than 17,100 people in Gaza -- 70% of them women and children -- and wounded more than 46,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says many others are trapped under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, the international aid group, said another 115 bodies arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah in a 24-hour period.\n\n\"The hospital is full, the morgue is full,\" the group said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe military said Thursday that it struck dozens of militant targets in Khan Younis, including a tunnel shaft from which fighters had launched an attack. It said two of the attackers were killed.\n\nIn the afternoon, a heavy strike near a main intersection in the center of Khan Younis left a large field of rubble, and survivors said many people were believed buried underneath. Rescuers pulled bloodied women and children from the shells of nearby buildings gutted in the blast and a pickup truck rushed off carrying several wounded men.\n\nHamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war, and took some 240 people hostage. An estimated 138 hostages remain in Gaza, mostly soldiers and civilian men, after 105 were freed during a cease-fire in late November.\n\nA built-up refugee camp inside Khan Younis was the childhood home of Hamas' top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, and the group's military chief, Mohammed Deif, as well as other Hamas leaders -- though their current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nHeavy fighting is also still underway in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, even after two months of heavy bombardment and encirclement by ground troops. The military said troops raided a militant compound, killing a number of fighters and uncovering a network of tunnels.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to confirm the latest reports from the battlefield.\n\nIsrael blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas, accusing it of using civilians as human shields when the militants operate in residential areas. But Israel has not given detailed accounts of its individual strikes, some of which have leveled entire city blocks.\n\nThe military says 87 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. It also says some 5,000 militants have been killed, without saying how it arrived at its count.\n\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS WORSENS\n\nTens of thousands of people have fled from Khan Younis and other areas to Rafah, on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, the U.N. said, adding that five U.N. schools where displaced people were sheltering in Khan Younis were completely evacuated after direct orders from the Israeli military.\n\nRafah, normally home to around 280,000 people, is already hosting more than 470,000 who fled from other parts of Gaza.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Egypt has deployed thousands of troops and erected earthen barriers to prevent any mass influx of refugees. It says an influx would undermine its decades-old peace treaty with Israel, and it doubts Israel will let them back into Gaza.\n\nFor days now, aid groups have been able to distribute supplies only in and around Rafah, and mainly just flour and water, the U.N.'s humanitarian aid office said. Access farther north has been cut off by fighting and Israeli forces closing roads.\n\nWithin shelters in the south, communicable diseases have significantly increased, along with cases of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions such as lice, the U.N. said.\n\nThe World Food Program said a \"catastrophic hunger crisis\" threatens to \"overwhelm the civilian population.\"\n\nGaza has been without electricity since the first week of the war, and hospitals and water treatment plants have been forced to shut down for lack of fuel to operate generators. Israel allows a trickle of aid from Egypt but has greatly restricted imports of fuel, saying Hamas diverts it for military purposes.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel would allow small deliveries of fuel into the southern Gaza Strip \"from time to time\" to prevent the spread of disease. The \"minimal amount\" of fuel will be set by the war cabinet, he said.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Israeli military says 87 of its soldiers have been killed during the Gaza ground offensive, not 88.\n\nChehayeb reported from Beirut.\n\nFull AP coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.", "source"=>{"uri"=>"register-herald.com", "dataType"=>"news", "title"=>"Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors"=>[{"uri"=>"associated_press@register-herald.com", "name"=>"Associated Press", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}, {"uri"=>"najib_jobain@register-herald.com", "name"=>"Najib Jobain", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}, {"uri"=>"kareem_chehayeb@register-herald.com", "name"=>"Kareem Chehayeb", "type"=>"author", "isAgency"=>false}],

                "body"=>"Brussels is on the cusp of approving unprecedented new regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) systems, establishing the most comprehensive controls on AI yet seen in the Western world, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\n\nIn lengthy negotiations that stretched late into Wednesday night, delegates from the European Commission, Parliament, and 27 member states reached a tentative compromise on rules that would govern AI systems like chatbots and generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. Sources close to the closed-door talks say a formal deal is expected early Thursday morning.\n\nThe new AI Act would be the first major regulation of AI systems outside of Asia and would fill a notable void left by inaction from the U.S. Congress. Technology policy experts see the rules as likely setting an influential precedent for AI governance globally.\n\nStrict new controls for Generative AI\n\nAmong the most complex negotiations have centered around specific requirements for generative AI systems -- AI tools capable of producing original text, images, audio, and video on command. These systems include chatbots like ChatGPT and creative tools like DALL-E 2.\n\nThe tentative deal would mandate that developers of generative AI maintain detailed documentation on how models are trained and what copyrighted source material is utilized. Models would need to be clearly labeled as AI-generated.\n\nFor exceptionally high-risk generative AI deemed to pose \"systemic risks,\" additional oversight rules would apply. This could include forming an industry council to monitor for harm, documenting any incidents, and coordinating with EU regulators.\n\nAddressing harm while supporting innovation\n\nFor European officials, a key priority has been balancing the need to foster an indigenous AI industry against managing potential societal dangers from uncontrolled AI systems.\n\nSome European nations like France and Germany initially opposed regulations that they felt could undermine domestic AI startups and research hubs. The final language appears to have assuaged those concerns.\n\nWith elections coming in June, officials have raced to finalize language and pass regulations before a new Commission and Parliament takes office. The technical specifics will still need to be refined in follow-up meetings between national representatives.\n\nBut the broad guardrails now appear set.

The clause states that a legislator can be disqualified if they are convicted of \"any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years unless a period of five years has elapsed since his release\".\n\nNotably, on August 29, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) suspended Imran's sentence in the case. The fresh petition was filed by PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and Ali Zafar on Imran's behalf.\n\nThe ECP was named as a respondent in the petition. It urged the court to declare the electoral watchdog's notification disqualifying Imran \"unlawful, illegal and unconstitutional\", Dawn reported.

However, the full text of the 36-page order by the ECP was silent on lifetime or five-year disqualification for Imran. Subsequently, the then-IHC chief justice had observed that the law did not bar the former premier from contesting polls and the ECP had disqualified him only on his Mianwali seat for \"concealing\" details of Toshakhana gifts.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the Islamabad HC had rejected Imran's application to withdraw his appeal against disqualification in the Toshakhana reference in order to enable him to pursue the matter in the LHC, Dawn reported.
